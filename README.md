*****************"Add Contact" button. *****************

--> Directs to another page where user sees 4 input fields like 'Firstname', 'Lastname', 'Phone Number', 'Mail Id', Submit button, Discard button.

--> User can only enter numbers in phone number field and proper mail id format in mail id field.

--> After entering details and if user enters discard button then all details will be removed.

--> If user clicks submit button it directs to store.php file. This scripting file intially connects to Mysql and the data gets stored in the database with 'insert mysql command'.
